# Collaborative Development Best Practices

To ensure smooth collaboration on the `my_pet` repository and prevent interference with other team members' work, it is recommended to follow these best practices:

## 1. Branching
Create separate branches for each ticket or task. This allows team members to work independently without conflicts. Branches provide isolation and make it easier to merge changes later.

```python
# To create new branch and checkout to it
git checkout -b <branch_name>
# To switch to an existing branch
git checkout <branch_name>
```

## 2. Ticket Assignment
Assign specific tickets or tasks to individual team members to avoid overlap or duplication of work. Clearly communicate who is responsible for each ticket.

## 3. Pull Requests
Once a team member completes their work on a ticket, they should create a pull request (PR) to merge their changes back into the main branch. Pull requests provide an opportunity for code review and ensure that changes are properly reviewed before merging.

```python
# To push branch to github
git push origin <branch_name>
# Then, navigate to the repository on GitHub and create a new pull request.
```

## 4. Code Reviews
Encourage team members to review each other's code. Code reviews help identify potential issues, improve code quality, and maintain consistency across the project. It also facilitates knowledge sharing and learning from each other.

## 5. Communication
Maintain open and transparent communication within the team. If multiple team members are working on the same repository, it's crucial to communicate and coordinate with each other. Inform others when you start working on a ticket and when you finish, so they know when it's safe to pull changes from the main branch.

## 6. Testing
Run tests locally before pushing changes. Ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality by running tests on your local environment. This helps catch any issues early on and prevents breaking the work of others.

By following these practices, your team can effectively collaborate on the `my_pet` repository while minimizing conflicts and disruptions to each other's work.
